Players with high ping can ruin fun for others and can cause server to lag.

You can enable autokick feature that will kick players that hit certain ping level,
by setting **sv_kickping** cvar:

```
sv_kickping <0-999>
```

By default this feature is enabled and set to 500 ping. To disable it, you need to set it to 0.
