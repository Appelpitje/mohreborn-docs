# Welcome

The MoH Reborn Project has been initiated to revitalize the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault game.

Its corner stone is an unofficial patch, created by the xNULL community, 
that has been in active development for over 10 years.

We also develop solutions for MoH:SH/BT/PA, and we continuously try to extend our efforts
into supporting those titles as well.

This website serves as documentation for MoH:AA Reborn 1.12 Patch and all other solutions we have built
during all those years (for example GameSpy's masterserver replacement).

We hope that users, which are both server admins and players, will find it useful.
