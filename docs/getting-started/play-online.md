It means that after May 31, 2014 - GameSpy masterserver, 
which kept list of all online MoH servers has been shut down. 

In-game browser stopped to work and players can't find new servers to play on anymore.

xNULL team and community decided to create a replacement for default masterserver and 
created custom Reborn MasterServer that supports MoH:AA/SH/BT and GameSpy protocol
in order to save the game we all love so much.

## Game Launcher

The easiest way to play MoH:AA/SH/BT games is to download and install MoH Reborn Game Launcher.
This is an open-source software created by us, to make player's lives easier.

It will patch your game executables so that they will query Reborn MasterServer instead of original one
to get list of all online servers and show them in the in-game server browser.

TODO Download link, installation guide and how to use it to patch the game

## Alternative solutions

If you don't want to install and use Reborn Game Launcher (which we highly recommend),
you can still make the in-game server browser work.
This will however require a bit more technical knowledge.
