## History

This project was started as xNULL project some time ago as the follower of MoH:AA Reloaded project. Due to lack of support and time, developers had to drop it, but now it's Reborn with new power and enthusiasm.
We gave it a new name, but we use old hosting site and some of the old sources from both previous projects.
Thats why we have a lot of people, from earlier projects and current one, who deserve to be mentioned as they have put a lot of work and effort to create some decent patch.
It doesn't matter if they have succeeded or failed, because as we said few lines above - we are using some of theirs work.

The MoH:AA 1.12 Reborn Project right now is too young and fresh to say who deserves to be mentioned in the credits. However, there are some people who have already done so many for the game and in some way for this patch, so we decided to mention them here.


First of all we all should thank James who saved old xNULL project from rotting and collapsing and brought the idea of restarting it as a final try in MoH:AA fixing. He made a lot of fixes for the game, did a lot of game engine reversing, invented a lot of original ways for fighting with cheaters

The rest won't be in any special order or something, because that doesn't really matter.
